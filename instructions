Introduction:
In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, deploying applications using Kubernetes has become a crucial aspect of modern software development. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up an end-to-end Kubernetes project, covering everything from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment and monitoring.

Prerequisites:
Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following in place:

Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts.
Access to AWS or any other cloud provider for server instances.
A TMDB API key for accessing movie databases in your Netflix Clone application.
DockerHub account for pushing and pulling Docker images.
Gmail account for email notifications.
Jenkins, Kubernetes, Docker, and necessary plugins installed.
High-Level Overview:
Infrastructure Setup: Provisioned servers for Jenkins, Monitoring, and Kubernetes nodes.
Toolchain Integration: Integrated essential tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, Trivy, Prometheus, Grafana, and OWASP Dependency-Check.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automated workflows with Jenkins pipelines for code analysis, building Docker images, and deploying applications on Kubernetes.
Security Scanning: Implemented Trivy and OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for vulnerabilities in code and Docker images.
Monitoring and Visualization: Set up Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization of both hardware and application metrics.
Email Notifications: Configured Jenkins for email alerts based on pipeline results.
You will get the Jenkinsfile and Kubernetes Manifest files along with the Dockerfile. Feel free to modify it accordingly

We need four servers for our today’s Project

Jenkins Server- On this Server, Jenkins will be installed with some other tools such as sonarqube(docker container), trivy, and kubectl.

Monitoring Server- This Server will be used for Monitoring where we will use Prometheus, Node Exporter, and Grafana.

Kubernetes Master Server- This Server will be used as the Kubernetes Master Cluster Node which will deploy the applications on worker nodes.

Kubernetes Worker Server- This Server will be used as the Kubernetes Worker Node on which the application will be deployed by the master node.

Let’s create the following instances.

Jenkins Server

Click on Launch Instances.
